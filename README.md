# course_difficulty_project
## Problem Statement
When we check the website "rate my professor". We can see lot of evluation aspects including dificluty of the course. We are curious that if we can evaluate the course dificulty level 
based on the traits of transcipt of online course.
## Natural Language Processing
We can use the natural language processing (NLP) when we are dealing with the text respectively. 
The output variable that we are considering is a continuous variable, therefore, we should be using regression techniques for predictions. 
And after several times of testing, we find the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) perform best. So we just using this methoad to do our task.
